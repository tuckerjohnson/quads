      \bold \italic { "...for me, the cowbell..." } is the third work composed for and with percussionist John McGovern in connection with his degree recitals at the University of Maryland.
      This multi-percussion piece is inspired by John's research on the cowbell and his wide interest in its place and function in musical culture.
      It is conceived primarily as in response to a passage in composer Helmut Lachenmann's 1978 essay
      \italic "Bedingungen des Materials. Stichworte zur Praxis der Theoriebildung:"
